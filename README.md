My first attempt at an MVC Framework

I started with the UDEMY course "Object Oriented PHP & MVC" and saw a lot of room for improvement on what the instructor covered since he had to worry about time constraints.

I have added:
 * SQL building for more automated and consistent query writing
 * A base Model class so one doesn't have to copy and paste the same methods into each model, they are inherited
 * Simple field validation in base Model
 
Future developments I hope to make:
 * An eaiser to use and more intuative Model
 * Built in Role Base Security
 * CRUD auto creation (similar to zii in the Yii framework)
